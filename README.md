Crime Analysis in San Francisco

This project focuses on analyzing crime data from San Francisco to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights. The goal is to better understand urban safety dynamics through data-driven analysis and visualization.

📊 Project Overview

The dataset contains details about reported crimes in San Francisco, including:

Crime category (e.g., theft, assault, vandalism)

Time of occurrence (date, hour, day of week)

Geographic location (district, latitude/longitude)
